      "Provide a priority score between 0 and 1 for each classification, where 1 indicates high prirority.",
      "If the email does not relate to any of the predefined request types, and it is not related to loan servicing, then classify it as 'off_topic' and assign the lowest priority.",
      "Money-related requests (e.g., loan disbursement, payment requests, etc.) should be given higher priority over other types because they are likely more urgent and require immediate attention.",
      "If there are multiple requests, any money-related or amount-related requests should be treated as the primary request (even if there are other non-money-related requests). Assign it a higher priority score.",
      "If the email contains multiple non-money-related requests, assign each request type an equal priority score. Example: If there is a request about loan details and a request for a document upload (both non-money-related), both requests will be treated equally for processing, but still prioritized as secondary to any money-related requests."
